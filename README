			README for Native NIFF "c" parser

1. What is it?

	A code generator that generates a nif parser code, for
reading/writing of .nif (NetImmerse File Format) game state files.


1.1. Description

	file: "convert2c.c" - the code generator
	build: make codegen
	usage: convert2c path to "nif.xml" from the "NifTools" project
	feats:
[x]	- generates basic types, enums and structures
	[x]	- handles fixed size arrays - 1d, 2d
	[x]	- handles dynamic size arrays - 1d, 2d, jagged2d,
		  const & field based indexes
	[x] - handles "TEMPLATE", "Key" and "KeyGroup"
[*]	- generates read functions
	[x]	- auto-group by version check - sequential only
	[ ]	- auto-group by version check - non-sequential
	[x]	- auto-group by (userver + vercond + cond)
	[ ]	- auto-group by (userver + vercond + cond) - non-sequential
	[x]	- handles the expressions in "cond" and "vercond"
	[x]	- handles 1d arrays
	[x]	- handles 2d/jagged arrays
	[ ]	- blockread of sequential fileds of non pointer basic types
	[ ] - range check protections
	[ ] - creates hashed read procs
[ ]	- generates write functions
	cons:
	[x]	- complex
	[x]	- buggy
	[x]	- slow

legend:
	[ ] - It can't do that
	[x] - It can do that
	[*] - Partial support
